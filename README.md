I am doing more commits on my repo to learn git basic exercises.
Editing this file because I resolved the merging conflict but I didn't make the neccessary changes to the file
I just replaced <<<<< sign on HEAD with >>>>> sign and left everything else as it was.
Hence, the merging went through afterwards.
